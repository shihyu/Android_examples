DroidCafe - Solution Code
=========================

App that demonstrates radio buttons, images used as buttons, the options menu,
up-button navigation, and a floating action button for an implicit intent.

Introduction
------------

This app created from the Basic Activity template lets a user tap image buttons
to launch an activity, and choose a single delivery option from radio-button
choices for a food order. The options menu includes choices, and the app displays
a Toast message showing the userâ€™s choice. The app also uses an implicit intent
so that when the user taps the floating action button, it launches the Maps app.
The Up button is included in the second activity to return to the main activity.
